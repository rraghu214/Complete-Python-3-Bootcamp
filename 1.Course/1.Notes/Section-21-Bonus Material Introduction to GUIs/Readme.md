### There are many,many Graphical User Interface options for Python users.

Here is the link to the documentation concerning the most common [GUI frameworks](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GUI%20Programming%20in%20Python).

For a full list of all available GUI frameworks, check out the [Full GUI Programming List](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming).


If you want to begin GUIs by designing a graphical game, your best bet would be [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/hifi.html)!

*If you want to build web apps, you'll probably want to avoid Python as the GUI and use it for backend work using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) or [ Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) instead. With web apps you'll want to explore HTML,CSS, and Javascript to provide the GUI for your user.**

**Let's explore the awesome world of Widgets in the Jupyter Notebook setting! This type of GUI is best suited for creating dashboards for data/business analysis situations.**
