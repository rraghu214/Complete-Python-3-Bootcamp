You can use Flask to create web pages with Python (as long as you know some HTML and CSS) and they use decorators a lot! Learn how they use [view decorators](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/viewdecorators/). Don't worry if you don't completely understand everything about Flask, the main point of this optional homework is that you have an awareness of decorators in Web Frameworks. That way if you decide to become a \\\"Full-Stack\\\" Python Web Developer, you won't find yourself perplexed by decorators. You can also check out [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) another (and more popular) web framework for Python which is a bit more heavy duty.\\n\",\n",
